 <li>Off-limits admin side for managing content (news articles, pictures, authors and topics)</li>
 <li>Landing page showing most recent five articles</li>
 <li>Ability to browse news articles by topic</li>
 <li>Tracking number of clicks/views per news article, recommending "most popular" articles based on total number of recent clicks</li>
 <li>That's about it ...</li>
</ul>

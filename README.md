[tr00news]

Exercise project for a Helsinki University course on web application design using Spring Boot and whatnot.

This is a simple mock news service with, roughly, the following features:
 ¤ Off-limits admin side for managing content (news articles, pictures, authors and topics)
 ¤ Landing page showing most recent five articles
 ¤ Ability to browse news articles by topic
 ¤ Tracking number of clicks/views per news article, recommending "most popular" articles based on total number of recent clicks
 ¤ ( That's about it ... )

Check it out in action here : https://tr00news.herokuapp.com/
